We generated 100 complete graphs for $N = 4,8,16$ nodes, drawing each $\theta_i$ uniformly from $[-2,2]$, $W_{ij}$ uniformly from $[0, 1]$ and applying the de-biasing procedure in Section \fxwarning{Reference!}. We set $\varepsilon = 0.01$. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:time}, our empirical worst-case results do indeed follow the shape of our theoretical bound, as a function of both problem size and curvature $\Lambda$. This suggests that the bound is in practice tight. In addition, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:errors} the total 1-norm error of the singleton marginals remain low, even with our relatively course tolerance on the free energy term.
